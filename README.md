# LinkedList
Basic Linked List in C++

Has data and pointer structure, with last pointer being NULL.
Complete with basic add, remove and print functions.
No bugs found.

Inside main(), the Linked List is set up to be of type int. However, this can be changed as the code is templated.

Code catches invalid option NUMBERS. It is not coded to detect strings or chars as the option input. Therefore, to perform properly, the user input must be only of type int for option choide and any index.

To run in terminal:

make

./LinkedList
